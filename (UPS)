--Using Temp Table to perform Calculation //CTE
DROP TABLE if exists #total_package_delivery_change
Create Table ##total_package_delivery_change
(
    totalpackages numeric,
    Date datetime
)

Insert into #total_package_delivery_change
Select dea.totalpackages, dea.date
From private.total_packages_delivered dea
Join private.eu_team vac
on dea.totalpackages = vac.totalpackages
and dea.date = vac.date
